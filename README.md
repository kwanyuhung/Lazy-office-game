# 1. Game Idea

the idea comes from some big IT company, and has excellent Work benefits, like playing games at work, or taking a nap, some of them will become lazy.*
so if I am a manager, I need to supervise their work, to let them earn more money.
(* this is because, at that time, I am a student, sorry about that and the older me! but it,s a fun idea to make this game)

# 2. Game Rule
player as manager will have 
an income(if the worker working will +$1 in every time frame) and
outcome(the company cost deducted every 10 sec, if lower than 0 if the manager can't pay the cost, game over!).

the worker: only work in their workplace, but sometimes (they will leave the place to sleep or walk around)
you need to "Tap" the worker, then they will get back to work, and earn money for you.

# 3. Game Content
player can increase the workplace to earn more money
included worker number , office desk number, also you can increase the worker earn ($ per second)
